                My goal is to become a front-end developer.I really wanna know that how a website works .How developer interacts with the user using web-languages. In that process recently I have learnt html,css,javascript,dom manipulation,es6 and many more.I am working very hard to get what I want.Practising daily for 5-6 hours.Using external sources for assignments or projects.Focused on projects, how can I make that better for user.It's really hard to get from google or any other resources but I don't give up .Also get motivated by our course instructor that 
                <blockquote>"No pain ,No Gain"</blockquote>
                that's true.So , I Won't give up on my dreams.No matter How hard I have to work.
